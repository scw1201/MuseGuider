A realistic museum guide with a professional appearance. Who has a calm, neutral facial expression and a composed demeanor. Whose presence is system-like rather than performative. Movements must remain subtle and restrained. The guide man casually indicates an upstairs direction. One hand lifts slightly upward to the side in a relaxed gesture, as if naturally referring to a higher level while speaking. The movement is brief and understated. The head stays mostly steady.
