A realistic museum guide with a professional appearance. Who has a calm, neutral facial expression and a composed demeanor. Whose presence is system-like rather than performative. Movements must remain subtle and restrained. The guide man is in an idle standby state. He is not speaking and shows no lip movement. His posture is stable. The overall motion is minimal and suitable for looping.
