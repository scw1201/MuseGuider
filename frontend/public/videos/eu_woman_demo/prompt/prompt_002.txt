A realistic museum guide with a professional appearance. Who has a calm, neutral facial expression and a composed demeanor. Whose presence is system-like rather than performative. Movements must remain subtle and restrained. The guide intentionally shifts attention toward a left exhibit. The head turns left first, eyes clearly locking to the left. One hand then extends laterally to the left side of the body, reinforcing the direction of gaze. The gesture is controlled and deliberate, not decorative. The body remains still, acting as a stable anchor. After the viewer’s attention is guided, the hand slowly returns to a resting position.
