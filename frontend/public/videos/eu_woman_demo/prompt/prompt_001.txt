A realistic museum guide with a professional appearance. Who has a calm, neutral facial expression and a composed demeanor. Whose presence is system-like rather than performative. Movements must remain subtle and restrained. The guide is in a listening and turn-yielding state. She is speaking briefly to invite the viewer to respond, with short and calm mouth movement. Her tone is gentle and neutral, without emphasis. Her head remains still, with no nodding, shaking, or expressive motion. She performs a single, simple inviting hand gesture. One hand moves slowly forward with an open palm, as if offering the conversational turn to the viewer. The gesture is brief, restrained, and clear. After the gesture, the hand returns to a resting position. No explanatory or expressive gestures are performed.
