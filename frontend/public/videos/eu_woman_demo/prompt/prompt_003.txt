A realistic museum guide with a professional appearance. Who has a calm, neutral facial expression and a composed demeanor. Whose presence is system-like rather than performative. Movements must remain subtle and restrained. The guide performs a clear and friendly greeting gesture using both hands. At the beginning, both hands lift simultaneously to about shoulder height. With palms facing slightly forward, the guide makes a small, gentle waving motion with both hands, signaling a welcoming greeting toward the viewer.

After the greeting, both hands smoothly and naturally lower back to a relaxed resting position near the body, The upper body remains upright with a slight forward inclination, conveying openness and politeness. The head stays stable and facing forward, with only a very subtle nod at the start of the greeting. Eye contact is steady and directed toward the viewer throughout the gesture. Facial expression is friendly and welcoming, with a gentle smile that conveys warmth and approachability, while remaining professional and composed. All movements are slow, smooth, controlled, and restrained. The overall impression is calm, professional, and clearly a greeting only, with no indication of explanation or pointing.
