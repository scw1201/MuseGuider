A realistic museum guide with a professional appearance. Who has a calm, neutral facial expression and a composed demeanor. Whose presence is system-like rather than performative. Movements must remain subtle and restrained. The guide performs a formal and graceful greeting gesture. At the beginning, both hands lift slowly to a composed position in front of the body, with palms angled inward in a reserved and elegant posture. The gesture resembles a polite ceremonial greeting, without waving or repeated motion. The movement is singular, smooth, and controlled. After the greeting, both hands return slowly and naturally to a resting position near the body. Her upper body remains upright, with a very slight forward inclination that conveys courtesy and respect. Her head stays stable and facing forward, with no nodding or expressive motion. Eye contact is gentle and calm, directed toward the viewer. Facial expression is serene and composed, with a subtle, restrained smile. All movements are slow, minimal, and deliberate, conveying elegance, dignity, and formality.
