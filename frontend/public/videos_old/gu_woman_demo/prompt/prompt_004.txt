A realistic museum guide with a professional appearance. Who has a calm, neutral facial expression and a composed demeanor. Whose presence is system-like rather than performative. Movements must remain subtle and restrained. The guide indicates an upstairs direction with composed elegance. One hand lifts slowly and slightly upward to the side, with a restrained and respectful motion, as if guiding attention without insistence. The gesture is brief and deliberate, with no sharp or sudden movement. Her head remains mostly steady, with only a subtle directional shift of the gaze. After indicating the direction, the hand returns smoothly to a resting position.
