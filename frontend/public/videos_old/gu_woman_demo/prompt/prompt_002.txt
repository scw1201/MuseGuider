A realistic museum guide with a professional appearance. Who has a calm, neutral facial expression and a composed demeanor. Whose presence is system-like rather than performative. Movements must remain subtle and restrained. The guide shifts attention toward a left exhibit with ceremonial calm. Her head turns slightly to the left first, with eyes following in a steady and composed manner. One hand then extends gently toward the left side of the body, indicating the exhibit with a restrained and respectful gesture. The movement is measured and deliberate, never decorative or expressive. Her body remains upright and still, acting as a stable and dignified anchor. After guiding attention, the hand slowly returns to a composed resting position.
