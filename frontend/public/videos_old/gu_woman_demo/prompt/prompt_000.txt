A realistic museum guide with a professional appearance. Who has a calm, neutral facial expression and a composed demeanor. Whose presence is system-like rather than performative. Movements must remain subtle and restrained. The guide is in a composed idle standby state. She is not speaking and shows no lip movement. Her posture is upright, balanced, and formal, reflecting calm presence and inner stillness. Her hands rest naturally and symmetrically in front of the body. Only extremely subtle natural motion is present, such as gentle breathing. No shifting, adjusting, or expressive movement occurs. The overall motion is minimal and suitable for seamless looping.
