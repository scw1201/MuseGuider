A realistic museum guide with a professional appearance. Who has a calm, neutral facial expression and a composed demeanor. Whose presence is system-like rather than performative. Movements must remain subtle and restrained. The guide is in a composed explaining state with refined and restrained elegance. She speaks briefly to invite the viewer to respond, with slow, minimal, and precise mouth movement. Her tone is calm, soft, and dignified, without emphasis or emotional fluctuation. Her head remains mostly still, maintaining a poised and upright alignment, with no nodding or expressive motion. She performs a single, subtle inviting hand gesture. One hand moves gently forward with an open palm, the motion small and controlled, as if offering the conversational turn with courtesy. The gesture is slow, restrained, and deliberate. After the gesture, the hand returns smoothly to a composed resting position. No explanatory, decorative, or expressive gestures are performed.
