A realistic museum guide with a professional appearance. Who has a calm, neutral facial expression and a composed demeanor. Whose presence is system-like rather than performative. Movements must remain subtle and restrained. The guide casually indicates an upstairs direction with calm grace. One hand lifts slightly upward to the side, with a restrained and formal gesture, as if guiding attention toward a higher level. The movement is subtle, composed, and deliberate. His head remains mostly steady, with a slight upward glance in line with the gesture. After indicating the direction, the hand slowly returns smoothly to a resting position.
