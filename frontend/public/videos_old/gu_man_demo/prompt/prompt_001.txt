A realistic museum guide with a professional appearance. Who has a calm, neutral facial expression and a composed demeanor. Whose presence is system-like rather than performative. Movements must remain subtle and restrained. The guide is in a composed explaining state with dignified elegance. He speaks briefly to invite the viewer to respond, with minimal, controlled mouth movement. His tone is calm, measured, and polite, with no emphasis. His head remains steady, with a slight natural tilt that reflects thoughtfulness, but no expressive motion. He performs a single, deliberate inviting hand gesture. One hand moves forward gently with an open palm, offering the conversational turn with a sense of formality. The gesture is slow, controlled, and respectful. After the gesture, the hand returns smoothly to a resting position. No complex or expressive gestures are performed.
