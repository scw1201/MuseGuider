A realistic museum guide with a professional appearance. Who has a calm, neutral facial expression and a composed demeanor. Whose presence is system-like rather than performative. Movements must remain subtle and restrained. The guide shifts attention toward a left exhibit with composed elegance. His head turns slightly to the left, with his eyes following the movement, locking onto the exhibit in a calm, deliberate manner. One hand extends toward the left side of the body, directing attention to the exhibit with a restrained and formal gesture. The gesture is purposeful, minimal, and clear, with no extraneous or decorative motion. His body remains still and stable, acting as a calm anchor. After guiding attention, the hand returns smoothly to a resting position.
