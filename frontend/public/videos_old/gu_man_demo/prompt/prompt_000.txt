A realistic museum guide with a professional appearance. Who has a calm, neutral facial expression and a composed demeanor. Whose presence is system-like rather than performative. Movements must remain subtle and restrained. The guide is in a composed idle standby state. He is not speaking and shows no lip movement. His posture is upright and poised, reflecting calm and stillness. His hands remain still and visible, resting naturally at the sides or in front of the body. There is no shifting or adjusting; only very subtle natural motion, such as gentle breathing. The overall motion is minimal, smooth, and appropriate for seamless looping.
