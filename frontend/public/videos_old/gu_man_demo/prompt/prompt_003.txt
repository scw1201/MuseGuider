A realistic museum guide with a professional appearance. Who has a calm, neutral facial expression and a composed demeanor. Whose presence is system-like rather than performative. Movements must remain subtle and restrained. The guide performs a formal, dignified greeting gesture using both hands. Both hands lift slowly to about chest or shoulder height, palms facing slightly inward, in a respectful gesture. The movement is composed, small, and graceful, reflecting formal respect. After the greeting, both hands return naturally and smoothly to a resting position near the body. His upper body remains upright, with a slight forward inclination, conveying a sense of courtesy and openness. His head remains facing forward, with a subtle nod at the beginning of the greeting. Eye contact is steady and deliberate, directed toward the viewer. His facial expression is serene and polite, with a slight, restrained smile that conveys warmth without excess. All movements are slow, smooth, and controlled, emphasizing poise, professionalism, and respect.
